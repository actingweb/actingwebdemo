"""
Application-specific hooks for ActingWeb demo.

These hooks implement your application's business logic:
- Methods: RPC-style read-only operations (calculate, search, etc.)
- Actions: Operations with external effects (notifications, logging)
- Callbacks: Webhooks for external services (email, SMS, payments)
- Properties: Property access control and validation
- UI: Custom pages under /www endpoint

Customize these hooks to build your application's functionality.
