"""
Shared lifecycle hooks for ActingWeb demo applications.

Lifecycle hooks handle actor lifecycle events. These are automatically triggered
by the framework at specific points in an actor's lifecycle - they cannot be
called directly via API endpoints.

Available Lifecycle Events:
- actor_created: Called when a new actor is created
- actor_deleted: Called before an actor is deleted
- oauth_success: Called after successful OAuth authentication

These hooks are useful for:
- Setting initial actor properties
- Performing cleanup on deletion
- Recording authentication events
- Integrating with external systems on actor state changes

        - interface_version: Which ActingWeb interface is being used
        - created_at: Timestamp of actor creation

        Handle actor deletion event.

        Triggered: Automatically before an actor is deleted via DELETE /{actor_id}

        This hook allows for custom cleanup operations before the actor
        is removed. The framework handles standard cleanup (properties,
        trust relationships, subscriptions) automatically.

        Use cases:
        - Notify external systems of actor removal
        - Archive actor data before deletion
        - Clean up external resources

        Handle successful OAuth authentication event.

        Triggered: Automatically after successful OAuth callback

        This hook is called when a user successfully completes OAuth
        authentication. It's useful for:
        - Recording authentication timestamps
        - Triggering post-authentication workflows
        - Updating user preferences from OAuth provider data

        Parameters:
            actor: The ActorInterface for the authenticated user
            **kwargs: May include OAuth provider data, tokens, etc.

        Returns:
            True to allow the OAuth flow to continue
            False to reject the authentication (not common)
