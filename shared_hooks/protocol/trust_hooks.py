"""
Shared trust hooks for ActingWeb demo applications.

Trust hooks handle trust relationship events in ActingWeb. These are triggered
when trust relationships are created, modified, or deleted.

Available Trust Lifecycle Events:
- trust_approved: Called after a trust relationship is approved by both parties
- trust_deleted: Called before a trust relationship is deleted

These hooks are useful for:
- Logging trust relationship changes
- Triggering workflows when new trust relationships are established
- Performing cleanup when trust relationships are removed
- Integrating with external systems for trust management

        Handle trust approval event.

        Triggered: Automatically when a trust relationship is approved by both parties

        This hook is called when a trust relationship becomes fully established
        (both this actor and the peer have approved the relationship).

        Use cases:
        - Log trust relationship establishment
        - Notify external systems
        - Initialize resources for the trusted peer
        - Set up initial data sharing subscriptions

        Parameters:
            actor: The ActorInterface for this actor
            peer_id: ID of the peer actor in the trust relationship
            relationship: Type of relationship (e.g., "friend", "admin", "associate")
            trust_data: Dictionary containing full trust relationship details
            **kwargs: Additional context

        Handle trust deletion event.

        Triggered: Automatically before a trust relationship is deleted

        This hook is called before a trust relationship is removed. Use it to
        perform cleanup operations before the trust is deleted.

        Use cases:
        - Log trust relationship removal
        - Clean up shared resources
        - Notify external systems
        - Archive relationship data

            actor: The ActorInterface for this actor
            peer_id: ID of the peer actor whose trust is being removed
