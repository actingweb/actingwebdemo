"""
Protocol-level hooks for ActingWeb.

These hooks handle core ActingWeb protocol functionality:
- Subscriptions: Data exchange between trusted actors
- Trust: Trust relationship lifecycle events
- Lifecycle: Actor creation, deletion, OAuth events

These are framework-level hooks that implement the ActingWeb protocol,
not application-specific business logic.
