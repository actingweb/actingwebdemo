"""
Shared subscription hooks for ActingWeb demo applications.

Subscription hooks handle the ActingWeb subscription protocol - the mechanism
by which trusted actors can subscribe to changes in each other's data.

This is PROTOCOL-LEVEL functionality, not app-specific. When Actor A subscribes
to Actor B's properties, Actor B will send subscription callbacks to Actor A
whenever those properties change.

The subscription hook processes incoming subscription data from trusted peers
and determines how to handle the updates (store them, trigger actions, etc.).

For app-specific external webhooks (email verification, SMS, payment callbacks),
see callback_hooks.py instead.

        Handle incoming subscription data from trusted peers.

        Triggered: When a trusted peer sends subscription data updates

        This hook is called by the ActingWeb framework when an actor we've
        subscribed to sends us updated data. The subscription was established
        via the /subscriptions endpoint after a trust relationship was created.

        Parameters:
            actor: The local ActorInterface receiving the data
            subscription: Subscription metadata including:
                - subscriptionid: Unique identifier for this subscription
                - target: What we subscribed to (e.g., "properties")
                - subtarget: Optional sub-path within target
                - granularity: Level of detail in updates
            peer_id: ID of the peer actor sending the data
            data: The subscription payload (structure depends on target)

        Returns:
            True to acknowledge successful processing
            False to indicate processing failed (peer may retry)

        Example subscription flow:
            1. Actor A creates trust with Actor B
            2. Actor A subscribes to Actor B's properties
            3. Actor B updates a property
            4. Actor B sends the update to Actor A via this hook
            5. Actor A processes and stores the update
