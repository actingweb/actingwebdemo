Shared hooks for ActingWeb demo applications.

This module provides common hook implementations organized by purpose:

Protocol-Level Hooks (shared_hooks/protocol/):
    ActingWeb core protocol functionality
    - subscription_hooks: Handle data from actor-to-actor subscriptions
    - trust_hooks: Handle trust relationship lifecycle events
    - lifecycle_hooks: Handle actor creation, deletion, OAuth events

App-Specific Hooks (shared_hooks/app/):
    Your application's business logic
    - method_hooks: RPC-style read-only operations (calculate, search, etc.)
    - action_hooks: Operations with external effects (notifications, logging)
    - callback_hooks: Webhooks for external services (email, SMS, payments)
    - property_hooks: Property access control and validation

Usage:
    from shared_hooks import register_all_shared_hooks

    app = ActingWebApp(...)
    register_all_shared_hooks(app)
